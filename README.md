## Description

The Prework-Study-Guide is a collective of notes on HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript for students going through the prework. It was built and intended to be a reference guide for information learned throughout the prework assignment. It solves the problem of information overload for new bootcamp students by creating a visual framework for them to regularly update and reference as the course goes on. I learned the broad general structure of HTML, CSS style sheets, Git, and how to integrate JavaScript to make a static web page interactive.

## Usage

There are four topics listed in the guide. Each individual section contains notes on a particular topic. If the DevTools console is opened on the page, JavaScript can be seen running and will list out the topics we learned from prework and will randomly select a topic to study first.
